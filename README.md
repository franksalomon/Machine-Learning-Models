## Problem Statement

The goal is to understand how demographic and product-related variables
(e.g., education level, income, gender, product ownership) influence
customer satisfaction and to build predictive classification models.

---

## Dataset

- Features: education level, income, gender, product ownership, etc.
- Target variable: satisfaction level (1–4).
- Data anonymized for academic purposes.

---

## Pipeline

1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation and comparison

---

## Models

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Neural Network

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall / F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## Key Results

(Add a small table with metrics here)

---

## Insights

- Most influential variables include X and Y.
- Certain customer segments show higher/lower satisfaction.

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install requirements  
3. Run the main notebook or script
